# .NetFramework-WPF_MVVM_APP
 Creating a WPF Application using Prism Library and MVVM Architectural Pattern.
This blog project explains how to develop a WPF application using a Prism library and MVVM architectural pattern. No matter how big or complex your app is, this base foundation stays the same for all types of projects. That's why it's very crucial to understand its behavior. We will learn how to make use of UnityContainer and how to achieve modularity in WPF applications using Prism.
 
Why Prism? Prism is a framework for building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable XAML applications in WPF.
